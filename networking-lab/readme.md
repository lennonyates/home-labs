# Networking Lab

## Purpose
In order to practice my networking skills, I set up a simulation of a real world business network. This lab contains a PfSense firewall, two Windows servers with Active Directory and DNS roles on one, and a file server role on the other, also a Windows 11 client machine to access and configure all the machines. I chose these machines and the client to access them as this is a simulation of how I would interact with machines in IT support roles.

## Technologies used

* Windows Server 2022 server core.
* PfSense firewall.
* Windows 11 Pro.
* Oracle VirtualBox 7.2.2.

## Skills Demonstrated

* Active Directory & DNS configuration.
* PfSense firewall setup and management.
* DHCP, static IP, and network troubleshooting.
* Windows Server Core administration via PowerShell.
* Remote Desktop and network drive mapping.
